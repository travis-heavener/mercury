    # Controls temporary or permanent redirects for specific files or paths.

    # Note B: the pattern attribute does NOT capture query strings. Query strings are preserved from the original request.

    # How small a response body must be to bypass using any compression methods (in bytes)
    # This avoids the overhead and bloat of using compression algorithms on really
    # small bodies, however values that are too large (ie. > 1000 bytes) will increase
    # network overhead
    #   Default: 750
    <MinResponseCompressionSize> 750 </MinResponseCompressionSize>

    # Specifies how many connection threads exist for each server thread.
    # Note that under heavy load, up to MaxBurstThreadsPerChild threads may be created per

    #   Default: 12
    <IdleThreadsPerChild> 12 </IdleThreadsPerChild>

    # Specifies the maximum number of connection threads exist for each server thread under load.
    # Note that under normal circumstances, only the amount of IdleThreadsPerChild threads will
    # be used--up to MaxBurstThreadsPerChild threads will be utilized to decrease the overall size of
    # the connection backlog on each server thread to improve client performance.
    # There are four server threads: IPv4, IPv4 w/ TLS, IPv6, IPv6 w/ TLS
    #   Default: 60
