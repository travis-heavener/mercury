# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Mercury updates are released on a rolling basis.

There are no LTS versions planned for Mercury.

### Pre-Release Versions

Any version before v1.0.0 is a pre-release version, which may be more prone to bugs or security issues than official releases.
It is encouraged that users update Mercury whenever a new update is available.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
