# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Mercury is still in development as of right now, and any version before v1.0.0 is a pre-release version.
As such, any release may still have bugs and/or security vulnerabilities.
Each new release resolves issues and adds new features, so it's encouraged that you update when a new version is available.

Currently, there are no LTS versions planned for Mercury--the latest version is *always* going to be the recommended version of Mercury.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Should you encounter any security vulnerabilities, please open a Bug Report on the [Mercury GitHub repository](https://github.com/travis-heavener/mercury).

Bug Reports, especially security vulnerabilities, are taken very seriously and will be addressed as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please reach out to [Travis Heavener](https://github.com/travis-heavener) on GitHub or via email [travis.heavener@gmail.com](mailto:travis.heavener@gmail.com)
